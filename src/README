EBE Source Code
===============
The ebe source code is packaged as a gzipped tar file (.tgz).
Extract it using 

        tar xvzf ebe_src_2.5.8.tgz

This will unpack the files into a directory named "ebe".

Building the program - Linux & OS X
===================================

You will need g++, make, and the Qt development package.

There is a script named "rebuild" which will use qmake to
build a Makefile from "ebe.pro", run the script "qrc" to
build a resource file ("ebe_qrc.cpp"), use Qt Linguist's
lrelease program to build language packs, and use make to
compile the program.

After it is built you can copy ebe and all the .qm files
to a directory in the PATH.

Building the program - Windows
==============================

You will need the Visual C++ compiler and the Qt development
package.

You may use cygwin the untar the source.

Then using the Visual Studio command shell:

        cd ebe
        qmake
        make

This will compile ebe in the release directory.  You will
need to copy release\ebe.exe and the language pack files
(*.qm) into a directory in the PATH.

Then you can make a shortcut to the ebe program.
