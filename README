For most systems there is an install script which makes it simpler to install
ebe.  This script works well with the systems which incorporate a builtin
package manager.  Unfortunately OS X requires installing a couple of things
before running the script.

For Windows, there is an installation program which make it easy to install
ebe and a second installation program to instlla all required tools.

Installer
=========
This directory contains "install_ebe.sh" and the README file there explains
how to use it.

Windows
=======
There are binary installers built with Inno Setup in the Windows directory.

Windows users can also use git to download the source.  I have been using
Cygwin to provide git and the vi editor.  If interested, I have been compiling using the free Visual Studio 2010 C++ command line compiler with the Qt release for Visual Studio.  I also have separately installed a mingw verison of gcc, gfortran, gdb and the binary utilities along with yasm and astyle.  I have not yet documented where to find all the pieces.
