Help Wanted
===========
Ebe now supports translations to multiple languages and people are needed
to repair bad translations and translate more languages.

Work needs to be done on the library and on documentation.

It would be good to have a Windows developer and an OS X developer to assist
with those platforms.

It would be great to have someone with package management skills for Ubuntu
and Fedora to take over providing packages for these popular distros.

Good ideas are needed to help improve ebe.  One good idea would be to
develop an IntelliSense like facility for functions/classes

If you want to help, email me at ray.seyfarth@gmail.com

Universal installer
===================
The shell script "install_ebe.sh" will install ebe on a variety of Linux,
UNIX and UNIX-like systems including Ubuntu, Fedora, Slackware, OS X,
openSUSE, Mageia, Manjaro and PCBSD.  

OS X
----
Follow the instructions in README.OS_X to simplify the installation to
create a certificate named "gdb-cert".  If you do this first, the
installation script will do the rest.

Other systems
-------------
For the other systems the system's package manager is immediately
available and the process is simpler.

For Slackware the script must be run as root.  For the others sudo is used
only when needed, but the process does require root access using sudo.

Installing a different version
==============================
To install the latest version use

    sh install_ebe.sh

The script also can be used to update ebe or to select an older version.
If ebe is already installed, running the script again should quickly skip
through the installion of libraries and tools and then install ebe in a
minute or two.

To select an earlier version simply add the version number to the command
like this

    sh install_ebe.sh 2.6.0
