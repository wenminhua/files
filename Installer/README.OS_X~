MacPorts or Homebrew
--------------------

If you have Homebrew installed (http://brew.sh) it will be used by the script.
If Homebrew is not installed and MacPorts (http://www.macports.org) is
installed, the script will use MacPorts.  If neither is installed, it will
install Homebrew using the Apple-provided ruby command and then use Homebrew
to finish the process.  Homebrew will install compiled tools and libraries
which can save some time.

XCode command line tools
------------------------

The ebe install script will try to install the XCode command line tools.
If this has not been done, the script will exit and you will need to rerun
it after the tools are installed.

Certificate for codesigning gdb
-------------------------------

In order to use gdb to start and control a process, it is necessary to
create a codesigning certificate and then use the codesigning tool to
tell OS X you trust gdb.  Following that it is necessary to restart the
taskgated process.  It should be possible for someone to improve the
installation script to create the certificate, but so far I had failed to
make the various openssl commands work properly.

The simplest way to install ebe on OS X is to use the following commands
(adapted from http://wiki.freepascal.org):

1.  Open application "Keychain Access"
    You can find it in /Applications/Utilities.

2.  Use menu option
    "Keychain Access->Certificate Assistant->Create a Certificate"

3.  Set these values
        Name             = gdb-cert
        Identity Type    = Self Signed Root
        Certificate Type = Code Signing
    Select "Let me override defaults"
    Click "Continue"

4.  Next you will see a dialog with a "Validity Period (day)" field.
    You might want to change this from 365 to 3650.  Then click
    "Continue".

5.  Just click "Continue" on the "Certificate Information" dialog.
    Having "US" selected is sufficient.

6.  Again click "Continue" on the "Key Pair Information" dialog.
    Having 2048 bit RSA is fine.

7.  Click "Continue" on the "Key Usage Extension" dialog.  It should
    have check marks beside
        "Include Key Usage Extension"
        "This extension is critical"
        "Signature"

8.  Click "Continue" on the "Extended Key Usage Extension" dialog.
    It should have checks by
        "Include Extended Key Usage Extension:
        "This extension is critical"
        "Code Signing"

9.  Click "Continue" on the "Basic Constraints Extension" dialog.
    It should have nothing checked.

10. Click "Continue" in the "Subject Alternate Name Extension dialog.
    It should have a check by
        "Include Subject Alternate Name Extension"

11. Finally on the "Specify a Location for the Certificate" dialog
    change the "Keychain" choice to "System".  Leaving it as "login"
    might work.
    Then click "Create".

After entering your password in the popup dialog, the certificate will
be created and you can quit the Keychain Access program.

You should then run "sh ./install_ebe.sh" in a terminal window.

Codesigning manually
--------------------

If you run the ebe installation script without creating "gdb-cert"
first, it will need to be done later and you will also need to do a
couple more commands.

If you used brew

    codesign -s gdb-cert /usr/local/bin/gdb

If you used MacPorts

    codesign -s gdb-cert /opt/local/bin/ggdb

Then you need to restart the taskgated process

    sudo killall -9 taskgated
